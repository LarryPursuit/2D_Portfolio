# 2D Developer Portfolio!

Inspired by the 2D platformer games, I created a 2D developer portfolio. The portfolio is a 2D platformer game where the player can move around the map and interact with the objects. The portfolio is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Kaboom.js. This is meant as a template that you can use to build your own. It works on both desktop
and mobile.
